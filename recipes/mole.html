            <p>These Chicken Mole Enchiladas are restaurant delicious, exploding with authentic Mexican flavor and destined to become a new family favorite! Warm, pan-fried corn tortillas are stuffed with juicy Chicken Mole, tangy sour cream and buttery Monterrey Jack cheese, rolled and tucked into a pan, then blanketed with a rich, sweet, spicy, smoky, fruity, velvety mole sauce, sprinkled with more cheese, then baked to crispy-gooey cheesy perfection. This chicken enchilada recipe is always a crowd-pleaser, can be prepped in the morning and baked at night, made in mass quantities, and/or frozen for later for the ultimate make-ahead dinner. It also makes terrific leftovers.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Poach the chicken in water, bouillon and orange juice, then shred. </li>
                <li>To make the Mole Sauce, sauté onions and garlic then add toasted whole spices, sunflower seeds and almonds, dried chilies, tomatoes, tomatillos, raisins, and some of the reserved broth from making the chicken. Simmer for about 25 minutes until the chilies are tender.</li>
                <li>Puree everything in a blender until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Pour about half of the sauce over the shredded chicken and stir to coat and reserve the rest for topping the enchiladas (you won’t use quite all of it). </li>
                <li>Working with one tortilla at a time, add tortilla and lightly fry for about 10 seconds on each side, just until soft with a few bubbles but not brown or crisp. Repeat with all tortillas. 
                </li>
                <li>Add shredded Chicken Mole to a large bowl and combine with cheese.  This makes assembly extra quick!</li>
                <li>Spread ½ cup Mole Sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased 9×13 baking dish (layer will be very thin).</li>
                <li>Slater each tortilla with a generous amount of sour cream (optional), then top with a generous amount of shredded chicken/cheese (about ⅓ cup).</li>
                <li>Roll up each tortilla and place seam side down in prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. </li>
                <li>Top enchiladas evenly with sauce followed by remaining cheeses.</li>
                <li>Bake enchiladas until cheese is melted and enchiladas are warm throughout.</li>

            </ol>
